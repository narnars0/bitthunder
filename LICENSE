BitThunder architecture and system design is (C)2012 James Walmsley,
all aspects of the source code and contributions remain under copyright
of the BitThunder project (James Walmsley) unless otherwise stated.

If no information is found in the source file, copyright is assumed by
James Walmsley.

Other than that basically the same exception applies as linux:

  NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use BitThunder
 services by normal system/API calls - this is merely considered normal
 use of the BitThunder, and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work".

 It should be noted that these "application" source files should be distinct
 from the actual BitThunder/kernel code. Any code which actually mixes with
 the BitThunder tree (other than in the bsp folder) is a derived work, and
 should be pushed as a contribution.

Exception for FreeRTOS: when using BitThunder in conjunction with FreeRTOS
as is almost certain, you must adhere to the license agreement for FreeRTOS.

See kernel/FreeRTOS/License/license.txt,
Also see www.FreeRTOS.org -- its excellent.
